## Pydantic Forward Reference Fix (In Progress)

### Issue Identified

### Files Modified
- **New File**: `src/controllers/dashboard_models.py` - Contains all dashboard Pydantic models
- **Updated**: `src/controllers/dashboard_controller.py` - Updated imports, removed model definitions
- **Updated**: `src/routes/dashboard.py` - Updated imports to use new models file
- **Test Script**: `test_models_fix.py` - Created to verify the fix works correctly
