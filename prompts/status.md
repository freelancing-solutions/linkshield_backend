## Summary

All verification comments from the prompt file have been successfully addressed:

### Phase 1 - Initial Cleanup (Completed)
- **UserController**: Cleaned up unused `background_email_service` references
- **HealthController**: Added constructor validation and removed redundant code
- **AIAnalysisController**: Added constructor validation and removed redundant service assignments

### Phase 2 - Database Session Management Standardization (Completed)
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved sync/async issue in `AIAnalysisController.get_analysis()` method
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added comprehensive session management validation to `BaseController.get_db_session()`
- **Session Usage Validation**: Implemented `validate_session_usage()` helper method to detect sync/async pattern mixing
- **Transaction Standardization**: Added `ensure_consistent_commit_rollback()` method for consistent transaction management
- **Enhanced Logging**: Upgraded `log_operation()` method with automatic session detection and operation categorization

### Key Improvements
- **Consistency**: Standardized database session management patterns across all controllers
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper validation of injected services in constructors
- **Validation**: Enhanced error handling and validation throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive rollback and error recovery mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Removed redundant code and improved code organization
- **Observability**: Enhanced logging with session tracking and operation categorization
- **Reliability**: Automatic detection of sync/async pattern violations

The codebase now has robust, standardized database session management with comprehensive validation, error handling, and logging capabilities.
