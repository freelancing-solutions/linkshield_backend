I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I've thoroughly analyzed the LinkShield backend codebase and understand the comprehensive social protection infrastructure already in place. The system has mature FastAPI architecture with social media scanning, platform adapters, authentication, and database models. The user wants to add bot functionality for Twitter, Telegram, and Discord that provides quick-access (â‰¤3 second) responses using existing analysis capabilities. The current `SocialScanService` performs comprehensive multi-minute scans, so we need a lightweight "quick analysis" path that reuses existing logic with timeouts and caching.

### Approach

The implementation will add a new bot layer on top of the existing social protection infrastructure. We'll create platform-specific bot handlers (Twitter, Telegram, Discord) that connect to a unified `QuickAccessBotGateway`. This gateway will use a new `QuickAnalysisService` that wraps existing platform adapters with 3-second timeouts and caching. Bot webhooks will be handled through new FastAPI routes with bot-specific authentication. The design reuses existing models, services, and database infrastructure while adding the minimal components needed for real-time bot interactions.

### Reasoning

I explored the codebase structure starting with the main application entry point and social protection module. I examined the existing platform adapters, services, controllers, routes, and authentication system to understand integration patterns. I reviewed the data models to understand request/response structures and checked the requirements.txt for available dependencies. This gave me a complete picture of the current architecture and how bot functionality should integrate.

Implement the `QuickAccessBotGateway` class that serves as the central coordinator for all bot platforms. This class will handle command parsing, route requests to the appropriate quick analysis service, and format responses for each platform. Include methods for `handle_quick_request()`, `classify_request()`, and `format_platform_response()`.

Include methods for `process_webhook()`, `parse_dm_command()`, `parse_mention_command()`, `send_dm_response()`, and `send_mention_reply()`. The handler will validate Twitter webhook signatures and handle rate limiting according to Twitter's API limits.

### src\bots\handlers\telegram_bot_handler.py(NEW)

Implement `TelegramBotHandler` class that processes Telegram webhook updates, handles both direct messages and inline queries, parses bot commands, and sends responses. Include methods for `process_webhook()`, `handle_message()`, `handle_inline_query()`, `send_message()`, and `answer_inline_query()`. Support Telegram's custom keyboards for quick actions and handle file uploads for content analysis.

### src\bots\handlers\discord_bot_handler.py(NEW)

- src\social_protection\platform_adapters\twitter_adapter.py
- src\social_protection\platform_adapters\base_adapter.py

Create `QuickAnalysisService` class that provides fast, lightweight analysis by wrapping existing social protection services with strict timeouts and caching. Implement methods for `quick_profile_analysis()`, `quick_content_analysis()`, and `quick_risk_assessment()` that reuse logic from `SocialScanService` and platform adapters but with 3-second limits. Include caching mechanisms to store recent analysis results and fallback responses for timeout scenarios.

### src\models\bot.py(NEW)

References: 

- src\models\user.py

Create database models for bot operations including `BotCommand` for logging bot interactions, `BotUser` for mapping external platform users to LinkShield users, and `BotSession` for tracking conversation state.

Create FastAPI router for bot webhook endpoints including `/api/v1/bots/twitter/webhook`, `/api/v1/bots/telegram/webhook`, and `/api/v1/bots/discord/webhook`. Each endpoint will validate platform-specific webhook signatures, parse incoming requests, and delegate to the appropriate bot handler. Include proper error handling, rate limiting, and logging for all webhook interactions.

### src\controllers\bot_controller.py(NEW)

References: 

- src\controllers\base_controller.py
- src\social_protection\controllers\social_protection_controller.py

Implement `BotController` class that handles business logic for bot operations including user mapping, command validation, rate limiting, and analytics. Include methods for `map_external_user()`, `validate_bot_command()`, `log_bot_interaction()`, and `get_bot_analytics()`. The controller will integrate with existing authentication and rate limiting systems while providing bot-specific functionality.

### src\controllers\depends.py(MODIFY)

References: 

- src\controllers\bot_controller.py(NEW)

Add dependency injection function `get_bot_controller()` that creates and returns a `BotController` instance with all required services. Follow the same pattern as `get_social_protection_controller()` to ensure consistent dependency management across the application.

### src\authentication\dependencies.py(MODIFY)

References: 

- src\models\user.py
