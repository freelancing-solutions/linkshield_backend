### Observations

After analyzing the codebase, I found that the social protection service has a solid foundation but is missing key components:

**Current State:**
- Main controller `SocialProtectionController` is fully implemented and wired to routes
- Two core services `ExtensionDataProcessor` and `SocialScanService` are complete
- Four of six service modules are implemented: `reputation_monitor`, `profile_scanner`, `crisis_detector`, and `platform_adapters`
- All platform adapters exist but need registration
- Database models and data models are in place

**Missing Components:**
- Two entire service modules: `content_analyzer` and `algorithm_health` (only `__init__.py` files exist)
- Three specialized controllers: `UserController`, `BotController`, `ExtensionController`
- Platform adapter registration in the registry
- Service integration and dependency injection setup

**Test Requirements:**
- Tests expect all six service modules to be functional
- Tests reference the three missing controllers
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality

### Approach

The implementation will follow a modular approach to complete the missing components while maintaining the existing architecture:

1. **Create Missing Service Modules**: Implement the two missing service packages (`content_analyzer` and `algorithm_health`) with their respective classes
2. **Add Specialized Controllers**: Create the three missing controllers as thin faÃ§ades over the main controller
3. **Complete Platform Integration**: Ensure all platform adapters are registered and functional
4. **Wire Dependencies**: Update dependency injection to support all new components
5. **Validate Integration**: Ensure all services work together and tests pass

This approach maintains modularity, avoids breaking existing functionality, and provides a complete, testable system.

### Reasoning

I analyzed the social protection codebase by examining the directory structure, reading key implementation files, and understanding the test requirements. I discovered that while the core architecture is solid with a main controller and two primary services, several components are missing. I checked the existing service modules, found that four are implemented but two are completely missing, and identified that three specialized controllers referenced in tests don't exist. I also verified the platform adapter structure and dependency injection setup to understand integration points.
