I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I've thoroughly explored the LinkShield backend codebase and understand the existing architecture:

**Current Infrastructure:**
- FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- PostgreSQL database with comprehensive user, project, and URL checking models
- Authentication system with JWT tokens and API keys with permissions
- Advanced rate limiting with Redis/in-memory storage and subscription-based multipliers
- Project-based dashboard with monitoring, alerts, and team collaboration
- AI analysis integration with OpenAI
- Comprehensive admin system and audit logging

**Existing Social Media Planning:**
- Documentation shows Twitter protection analysis and business strategy
- Clear understanding of platform penalties and algorithmic impacts
- Pricing strategy with multi-tier approach already defined

**Key Patterns Identified:**
- UUID primary keys with timezone-aware timestamps
- Enum-based status and type fields with JSONB for flexible data
- Relationship patterns with cascade deletes and back_populates
- Rate limiting decorators with scope-based configuration
- Controller pattern with typed Pydantic models and error handling
- Project-based organization with role-based access control

### Approach

The implementation will extend the existing LinkShield architecture by adding a new social protection domain layer that integrates seamlessly with current patterns. The approach follows the modular plugin architecture specified in the requirements:

**Phase 1 (Core Foundation):** Create the social protection module structure, database models, and basic API endpoints for browser extension integration.

**Phase 2 (Platform Adapters):** Implement Twitter/X protection adapter and content analysis engine with integration to existing AI services.

**Phase 3 (Dashboard Integration):** Extend the existing dashboard to surface social protection data and alerts within the current project-based structure.

The implementation leverages existing infrastructure (authentication, rate limiting, project management, AI services) while adding new specialized functionality for social media protection. This approach minimizes disruption to existing functionality while providing a solid foundation for the multi-platform social protection system.

### Reasoning

I explored the LinkShield backend codebase systematically to understand the existing architecture. I examined the project structure, requirements file, configuration patterns, and core models (User, URLCheck, Project) to understand the database patterns and relationships. I analyzed the authentication service to understand API key management and JWT token handling. I studied the advanced rate limiter to understand how to apply rate limiting to new endpoints. I reviewed the dashboard controller to understand the existing project-based organization and how to integrate social protection features. I also examined the existing social media shield documentation to understand the business requirements and technical approach already planned.
