I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I've completed a comprehensive code review of the `src/routes` directory and related files. I identified several bugs ranging from critical (duplicate function definitions) to minor (formatting issues and deprecated API usage). The bugs include:

1. **Critical**: Duplicate function definition in `dashboard.py`
2. **High**: Deprecated Pydantic v1 API usage in `report.py` and `algorithm_health.py`
3. **Medium**: Formatting issues in `url_check.py` and `report.py`
4. **Low**: Missing space in import statement

These bugs could cause runtime errors, compatibility issues with Pydantic v2, and code maintainability problems.


### Approach

I will create a comprehensive plan to fix all identified bugs in the routes directory:

1. **Fix duplicate function definition** in `dashboard.py` - remove the second `resolve_alert` function
2. **Update deprecated Pydantic validators** in `report.py` and `algorithm_health.py` - replace `@validator` with `@field_validator`
3. **Fix formatting issues** in `url_check.py` - correct spacing and line breaks
4. **Fix import statement** in `report.py` - remove extra space

Each fix will maintain backward compatibility where possible and ensure the code follows current best practices.


### Reasoning

I started by listing all files in the repository to understand the structure. Then I systematically read through the route files starting from `src/routes/`, examining `user.py`, `url_check.py`, `subscription_routes.py`, `social_protection.py`, `admin.py`, `bot_webhooks.py`, `health.py`, `dashboard.py`, `paddle_webhooks.py`, `ai_analysis.py`, `report.py`, `extension.py`, `algorithm_health.py`, and `monitoring.py`. I also checked the main `app.py` file. I used grep searches to find specific patterns like duplicate function definitions and deprecated decorators. I analyzed the code for syntax errors, logic bugs, deprecated API usage, and potential runtime issues.


## Proposed File Changes

### src\routes\dashboard.py(MODIFY)

**Bug Fix: Remove duplicate `resolve_alert` function definition**

The file currently has two `resolve_alert` function definitions:
- First at lines 421-432 (with `project_id` parameter)
- Second at lines 482-493 (without `project_id` parameter)

Python will only keep the last definition, causing the first endpoint to be inaccessible and potentially breaking functionality.

**Changes:**
1. Remove the duplicate function definition at lines 475-493
2. Keep only the first `resolve_alert` function at lines 414-432 which correctly includes the `project_id` parameter and matches the endpoint pattern `/projects/{project_id}/alerts/{alert_id}/resolve`

The second definition appears to be a mistaken duplicate that was added later and should be removed entirely. The first definition is the correct implementation as it:
- Follows the RESTful pattern with project_id in the path
- Matches the other alert management endpoints
- Has the complete parameter set including project_id, alert_id, current_user, and controller

### src\routes\report.py(MODIFY)

References: 

- src\routes\admin.py

**Bug Fix: Update deprecated Pydantic v1 API to v2**

The file is using deprecated Pydantic v1 decorators and imports which are incompatible with Pydantic v2 (used elsewhere in the codebase as seen in `src/routes/admin.py` which uses `@field_validator`).

**Changes:**

1. **Line 14**: Fix import statement - remove extra space after comma:
   - Change: `from pydantic import BaseModel,  Field, validator`
   - To: `from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator`
   - Also replace `validator` with `field_validator` for Pydantic v2 compatibility

2. **Line 54**: Update decorator from `@validator('url')` to `@field_validator('url')`
   - The function signature remains the same

3. **Line 65**: Update decorator from `@validator('tags')` to `@field_validator('tags')`
   - The function signature remains the same

4. **Line 88**: Update decorator from `@validator('tags')` to `@field_validator('tags')`
   - The function signature remains the same

These changes ensure compatibility with Pydantic v2 and prevent potential runtime errors. The `@field_validator` decorator is the Pydantic v2 equivalent of the v1 `@validator` decorator.

### src\routes\algorithm_health.py(MODIFY)

References: 

- src\routes\admin.py

**Bug Fix: Update deprecated Pydantic v1 API to v2**

The file is using deprecated Pydantic v1 `@validator` decorator which is incompatible with Pydantic v2.

**Changes:**

1. **Line 21**: Update import statement:
   - Change: `from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator`
   - To: `from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator`

2. **Line 251**: Update decorator from `@validator('analysis_types')` to `@field_validator('analysis_types')`
   - The function signature remains the same
   - This is in the `BatchAnalysisRequest` class

This ensures compatibility with Pydantic v2 used throughout the rest of the codebase (as seen in `src/routes/admin.py` and other files).

### src\routes\url_check.py(MODIFY)

**Bug Fix: Fix formatting issues in function signatures**

The file has minor formatting issues that affect code readability and consistency.

**Changes:**

1. **Line 161**: Fix spacing before closing parenthesis:
   - Change: `user: Optional[User] = Depends(get_optional_user) ):`
   - To: `user: Optional[User] = Depends(get_optional_user)`
   - Remove the extra space before the closing parenthesis

2. **Lines 206-208**: Improve function signature formatting for better readability:
   - Current: The function signature is split awkwardly with `bulk_check_urls(request: BulkURLCheckRequest, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,` on line 207 and `controller: URLCheckController = Depends(get_url_check_controller), user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):` on line 208
   - Reformat to have consistent indentation with each parameter on its own line or keep all parameters on one line if they fit
   - This improves code readability and follows Python PEP 8 style guidelines

These are minor formatting issues but fixing them improves code quality and maintainability.
