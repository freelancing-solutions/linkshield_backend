# Requirements Document: Social Protection Production Readiness

## Introduction

The social_protection module is a comprehensive social media protection system for LinkShield that provides multi-platform risk assessment, content analysis, algorithm health tracking, and crisis detection. While the module has extensive functionality defined, several components are incomplete or not fully integrated, preventing production deployment. This specification addresses the gaps to bring the module to production-ready status.

The module currently includes:
- **Controllers**: 4 specialized controllers (User, Bot, Extension, deprecated SocialProtection)
- **Services**: Extension data processor, social scan service
- **Analyzers**: Content risk, link penalty, spam pattern, community notes
- **Algorithm Health**: Visibility scorer, engagement analyzer, penalty detector, shadow ban detector
- **Platform Adapters**: Base adapter with 6 platform implementations
- **Crisis Detection**: Designed but not fully implemented
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive Pydantic models for all domains
