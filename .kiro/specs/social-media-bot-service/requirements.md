# Social Media Bot Service Requirements

## Introduction

The Social Media Bot Service provides a unified bot framework that facilitates communication between social media platforms (Twitter, Telegram, Discord) and LinkShield's social protection services. This service acts as a pure communication layer - bots handle platform-specific protocols and command interfaces, while all business logic for account safety analysis, compliance monitoring, and follower insights remains in the existing `social_protection` module.

The bot service's sole responsibility is to:
1. **Receive commands** from social media platforms through bot interfaces
2. **Forward requests** to the existing `BotController` in the social protection module  
3. **Format and return responses** back to the appropriate social media platform

All threat detection, risk analysis, compliance checking, and follower analysis logic remains in the existing social protection infrastructure. Bots are platform-specific communication handlers with no knowledge of the underlying business logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Account Safety Analysis Bot Commands

**User Story:** As a social media user, I want to request account safety analysis through bot commands, so that I can receive risk assessments about accounts I interact with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends an account analysis command (e.g., `/analyze_account @username`) THEN the bot SHALL parse the command and extract the account identifier
2. WHEN the bot receives a valid account analysis request THEN it SHALL forward the request to `BotController` with the account identifier and platform context
3. WHEN the bot receives a response from `BotController` THEN it SHALL format the response appropriately for the specific platform (Twitter thread, Telegram message, Discord embed)
4. WHEN formatting the response THEN the bot SHALL present risk scores, risk levels, and recommendations in a user-friendly format with appropriate emojis and platform-specific styling
5. WHEN the analysis is successful THEN the bot SHALL display the risk assessment with clear visual indicators (‚úÖ Safe, ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution, üö´ Risky, üî¥ Dangerous)
6. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the bot SHALL format them as actionable bullet points or numbered lists appropriate for the platform
7. WHEN a high-risk account is detected THEN the bot SHALL emphasize the warning with appropriate formatting and clear language
8. IF the analysis fails or times out THEN the bot SHALL display an appropriate error message and suggest the user try again or contact support

### Requirement 2: Content Compliance Check Bot Commands

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to check my content for compliance violations through bot commands, so that I can ensure my posts meet platform guidelines before publishing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a compliance check command (e.g., `/check_compliance "my content text"`) THEN the bot SHALL parse the command and extract the content to be analyzed
2. WHEN the bot receives a valid compliance check request THEN it SHALL forward the content and platform context to `BotController` for analysis
3. WHEN the bot receives a compliance analysis response THEN it SHALL format the results showing compliance score, violations found, and severity levels
4. WHEN formatting compliance results THEN the bot SHALL use clear visual indicators for violation severity (üü¢ Compliant, üü° Minor Issues, üü† Moderate Violations, üî¥ Severe Violations)
5. WHEN violations are detected THEN the bot SHALL format specific violation descriptions and remediation suggestions in an easy-to-read list
6. WHEN compliance analysis is successful THEN the bot SHALL provide actionable recommendations formatted appropriately for the platform
7. WHEN policy updates occur THEN the bot SHALL be able to notify users through platform-appropriate notification methods (DM, mention, etc.)
8. IF compliance analysis fails THEN the bot SHALL display an appropriate error message and suggest manual review or contacting support

### Requirement 3: Verified Followers Analysis Bot Commands

**User Story:** As an influencer or business account, I want to request verified follower analysis through bot commands, so that I can understand my audience quality and identify networking opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a verified followers command (e.g., `/analyze_followers` or `/verified_followers`) THEN the bot SHALL parse the command and identify the requesting user's account
2. WHEN the bot receives a valid follower analysis request THEN it SHALL forward the request to `BotController` with the user's account identifier and platform context
3. WHEN the bot receives follower analysis results THEN it SHALL format the data showing total verified followers, verification type breakdown, and high-value follower insights
4. WHEN formatting follower statistics THEN the bot SHALL present data in digestible chunks using platform-appropriate formatting (tables, lists, or structured text)
5. WHEN displaying high-value followers THEN the bot SHALL format networking opportunities and collaboration suggestions without exposing sensitive follower information
6. WHEN presenting follower categories THEN the bot SHALL use clear visual organization with appropriate emojis and grouping for easy reading
7. WHEN follower analysis is complete THEN the bot SHALL provide actionable networking recommendations formatted as clear, actionable steps
8. IF follower data cannot be accessed THEN the bot SHALL explain platform limitations clearly and suggest alternative approaches or manual methods

### Requirement 4: Unified Bot Command Interface

**User Story:** As a user across multiple social platforms, I want consistent bot commands and responses across Twitter, Telegram, and Discord, so that I can access the same functionality regardless of my preferred platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot service initializes THEN it SHALL register consistent command sets across all supported platforms (Twitter, Telegram, Discord)
2. WHEN a user sends the same command on different platforms THEN the bot SHALL provide functionally equivalent responses formatted appropriately for each platform
3. WHEN processing commands THEN the bot SHALL maintain consistent command syntax and parameter handling across platforms while respecting platform-specific limitations
4. WHEN platform APIs are unavailable THEN the bot SHALL provide consistent error messages across platforms and gracefully inform users of service limitations
5. WHEN rate limits are reached THEN the bot SHALL apply consistent rate limiting logic across platforms while respecting platform-specific rate limit requirements
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the bot SHALL provide helpful, consistent error messages formatted appropriately for each platform
7. WHEN new commands are added THEN the bot SHALL implement them consistently across all supported platforms
8. IF a platform becomes unsupported THEN the bot SHALL gracefully disable functionality on that platform and notify users through available channels

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Bot Response Performance

**User Story:** As a social media user, I want fast bot responses to my commands, so that I can get timely analysis results without long waits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a bot command THEN the bot SHALL acknowledge receipt immediately and provide analysis results within 3 seconds when possible
2. WHEN analysis takes longer than expected THEN the bot SHALL send a "processing" message to keep the user informed and provide updates
3. WHEN providing quick analysis results THEN the bot SHALL format responses to prioritize the most critical information first (risk level, immediate actions)
4. WHEN multiple analysis requests are made THEN the bot SHALL handle them efficiently using appropriate queuing and processing strategies
5. WHEN real-time updates are available THEN the bot SHALL be capable of sending follow-up messages or notifications as appropriate for the platform
6. WHEN bulk analysis is requested THEN the bot SHALL provide progress updates and batch results in manageable chunks
7. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the bot SHALL provide comprehensive results formatted for easy consumption on the specific platform
8. IF analysis fails or times out THEN the bot SHALL immediately inform the user and provide fallback options or cached results when available

### Requirement 6: Bot Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want assurance that my bot interactions and analysis requests are handled securely, so that I can use the service without compromising my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing bot commands THEN the bot SHALL only collect and forward data necessary for the requested analysis functionality
2. WHEN storing bot interaction logs THEN the bot SHALL use existing privacy-compliant logging mechanisms and respect data retention policies
3. WHEN handling user identifiers THEN the bot SHALL use platform-appropriate user identification without storing unnecessary personal information
4. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the bot SHALL support data removal requests through appropriate platform channels
