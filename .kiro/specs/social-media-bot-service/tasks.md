# Social Media Bot Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses on creating a pure communication layer between social media platforms and LinkShield's existing social protection services. All tasks involve building bot handlers, command parsing, response formatting, and gateway routing - with zero business logic implementation. All analysis and decision-making remains in the existing `BotController` in the social protection module.

- Each platform handler task includes its own unit testing

### Phase 2: Integration (Tasks 5-7)
- Task 5 requires completion of Tasks 1-4 (gateway routing needs handlers and models)
- Task 6 can be developed in parallel with Task 5 (BotController extensions)
- Task 7 requires completion of Tasks 2-6 (error handling needs all components)

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Tasks 8-11)
- Task 8 requires completion of Tasks 2-4 (response formatting needs handlers)
- Task 9 requires completion of Tasks 2-5 (webhook setup needs handlers and gateway)
- Task 10 can be developed in parallel with Tasks 8-9 (performance optimization)
- Task 11 can be developed in parallel with Tasks 8-10 (security features)

### Phase 4: Finalization (Tasks 12-14)
- Task 12 requires completion of all functional tasks (comprehensive testing)
- Task 13 can be developed in parallel with Task 12 (monitoring and analytics)
- Task 14 requires completion of all previous tasks (deployment and configuration)
