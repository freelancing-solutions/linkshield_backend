# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the creation of comprehensive technical documentation for the LinkShield client-side application. The documentation will serve as the foundational guide for agentic platforms and developers implementing the client application. The client is a React-based web application that consumes the LinkShield Backend API (https://www.linkshield.site/api/v1) and provides a complete user interface for URL security analysis, AI-powered content analysis, subscription management, and social protection features.

The documentation must clearly establish that the entire client application is API-driven, with all business logic residing in the backend. The client is responsible solely for presentation, user interaction, state management, and API communication. This architectural principle ensures a clean separation of concerns and enables the client to be a thin, maintainable layer over the robust backend services.

The documentation will be structured to provide both high-level architectural guidance and detailed technical specifications, enabling agentic platforms to understand the complete technology stack, architectural patterns, development workflows, and implementation standards required to build production-ready client features.
