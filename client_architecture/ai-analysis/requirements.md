# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Analysis feature provides users with AI-powered content analysis capabilities to detect phishing attempts, assess content quality, identify manipulation tactics, and discover similar content patterns.

2. WHEN history data is received THEN the system SHALL display table with content preview, risk level, phishing score, analyzed date, and actions
3. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update query parameters and refresh results
4. WHEN pagination controls are used THEN the system SHALL update page and page_size parameters
5. WHEN a user clicks on history row THEN the system SHALL navigate to analysis detail page
6. WHEN no history exists THEN the system SHALL display "No analyses yet" empty state
7. WHEN history request fails with 401 THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page

### Requirement 5: View Domain Statistics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view AI analysis statistics for a domain, so that I can assess the domain's historical threat patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to domain stats page THEN the system SHALL display domain input field
2. WHEN a user enters domain THEN the system SHALL validate domain format
3. WHEN a user submits domain lookup THEN the system SHALL call GET /api/v1/ai-analysis/domain/{domain}/stats
4. WHEN domain stats are received THEN the system SHALL display total analyses, average phishing score, average quality score
5. WHEN stats include threat distribution THEN the system SHALL display chart showing threat types over time
6. WHEN stats include analysis trends THEN the system SHALL display line chart showing scores over time
7. WHEN domain has no analysis data THEN the system SHALL display "No analysis data available for this domain"

### Requirement 6: Retry Failed Analysis

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retry a failed analysis, so that I can get results when the service is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views failed analysis THEN the system SHALL display "Retry Analysis" button
2. WHEN a user clicks retry button THEN the system SHALL call POST /api/v1/ai-analysis/analysis/{analysis_id}/retry with Bearer token
3. WHEN retry is successful THEN the system SHALL update analysis status to PROCESSING and poll for results
4. WHEN retry fails with 400 THEN the system SHALL display "Analysis cannot be retried"
