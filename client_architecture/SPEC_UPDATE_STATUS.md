## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **API Base URL**: Changed from `https://api.linkshield.site` to `https://www.linkshield.site/api/v1` to match backend
2. **Missing EARS Format**: All requirements now follow WHEN...THEN...SHALL pattern
3. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error code tables
4. **Missing Rate Limits**: Added rate limit information from backend docs
5. **Vague Requirements**: Made all requirements specific and testable
6. **Missing Non-Functional Requirements**: Added Security, Performance, Accessibility, Usability sections
7. **Incomplete Component Specs**: Added full TypeScript interfaces and data models

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating remaining feature specs in priority order:
   - API Keys (design + tasks)
   - URL Analysis (all 3 docs)
   - AI Analysis (all 3 docs)
   - Community Reports (all 3 docs)
   - Dashboard (all docs)
   - Homepage URL Checker (all docs)
   - Subscriptions (all docs)

2. Review and consolidate redundant specs:
   - Email Verification (merge into Authentication)
   - Profile Settings (merge into Authentication)
   - Sessions (merge into Authentication)

3. Create missing specs for features mentioned in app-spec.md:
   - Social Protection Extension
   - Social Protection User
   - Social Protection Crisis
   - Algorithm Health
   - Bot Webhooks

4. Final review of all specs for:
   - Consistency across features
   - Alignment with backend API
   - Completeness of requirements
   - Actionability of tasks
   - Testability of acceptance criteria
