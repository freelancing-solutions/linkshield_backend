## Feature Update Priority

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **URL Analysis** - Core product feature
2. **Dashboard** - Main user interface
3. **Homepage URL Checker** - Public-facing entry point
4. **Subscriptions** - Revenue critical

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
5. **AI Analysis** - Value-add feature
6. **Community Reports** - User engagement
7. **Email Verification** - May consolidate with Auth
8. **Profile Settings** - May consolidate with Auth
9. **Sessions** - May consolidate with Auth

## Key Issues to Fix Across All Specs

### 1. API Base URL
- **Current (Incorrect)**: `https://api.linkshield.site`
- **Correct**: `https://www.linkshield.site/api/v1`
- **Action**: Update all endpoint references

### 2. EARS Format
- **Current**: Vague functional requirements
- **Required**: WHEN...THEN...SHALL format
- **Example**: "WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields"

### 3. Error Handling
- **Current**: Generic error mentions
- **Required**: Complete error code table with HTTP status, user message, and action
- **Source**: Reference `docs/api/error-handling.md`

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Current**: Missing or vague
- **Required**: Specific rate limits per endpoint
- **Source**: Reference `docs/api/rate-limiting.md`

### 5. TypeScript Interfaces
- **Current**: Missing or incomplete
- **Required**: Complete interfaces for all data models, props, and API responses
- **Standard**: Use strict TypeScript with no `any` types

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Current**: Often missing
- **Required**: Security, Performance, Accessibility, Usability sections
- **Standard**: Specific, measurable requirements

## Consolidation Recommendations

### Features to Potentially Merge

**Email Verification** → Merge into Authentication
- Already covered in Authentication requirements (Req 3, 4)
- Design already includes VerifyEmailPage and ResendVerification
- Tasks already include email verification implementation

**Profile Settings** → Merge into Authentication
- Already covered in Authentication requirements (Req 6, 7)
- Design already includes ProfilePage and ProfileEditForm
- Tasks already include profile management implementation

**Sessions** → Merge into Authentication
- Already covered in Authentication requirements (Req 9)
- Design already includes SessionsPage and SessionsTable
- Tasks already include session management implementation

**Action**: Consider removing these separate spec folders and updating navigation/documentation to reference Authentication spec.
