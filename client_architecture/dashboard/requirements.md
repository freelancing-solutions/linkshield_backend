# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LinkShield Dashboard is a unified platform that serves multiple user personas with dedicated, tailored sections for each role. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, the dashboard provides distinct feature groups and workflows optimized for web developers, social media managers, brand managers, news/media houses, and company executives. The dashboard seamlessly integrates browser extension analytics and social media bot monitoring, exposing real-time protection data to enhance both passive scanning and active threat detection. Each persona accesses their own dashboard section with relevant tools, metrics, and integrations without being overwhelmed by features meant for other roles.

## User Personas

1. **Web Developers**: Focus on website monitoring, API integration, technical alerts
2. **Social Media Managers**: Focus on social platform monitoring, content analysis, engagement health
3. **Brand Managers**: Focus on brand protection, crisis management, reputation monitoring
4. **News/Media Houses**: Focus on content verification, source checking, misinformation detection
5. **Company Executives**: Focus on high-level metrics, risk overview, ROI analytics
