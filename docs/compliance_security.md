# Security and Compliance

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures and compliance considerations implemented in the LinkShield application.

## Security Architecture

LinkShield is built with security as a foundational principle, incorporating multiple layers of protection and industry-standard practices to safeguard user data and ensure service reliability.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Framework
- **Framework**: Authentication is managed by [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), a production-ready, open-source authentication solution
- **Session Management**: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management, stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies
- **Cookie Security**: All session tokens and cookies are signed with a strong, private `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, preventing tampering and unauthorized access
- **XSS Protection**: HTTP-only cookies mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks attempting to access session data

### Authorization System
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented through user roles (USER, ADMIN)
- **Admin Middleware**: Dedicated middleware (`src/lib/middleware/admin-middleware.ts`) enforces admin-only access to sensitive endpoints
- **Session Validation**: All protected routes validate user sessions using `getServerSession` from Next-Auth
- **API Protection**: Every API endpoint requiring authentication validates the user session before processing requests

### Authentication Implementation
```typescript
// Authentication configuration
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(db),
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      // Secure credential validation
      async authorize(credentials) {
        // User validation logic with bcrypt password hashing
      }
    })
  ],
  session: { strategy: 'jwt' },
  pages: {
    signIn: '/auth/signin',
    signUp: '/auth/signup'
  }
}
```

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Custom rate limiting middleware (`src/lib/middleware/rate-limit-middleware.ts`)
- **Limits**: 10 requests per minute per IP address
- **Scope**: Applied to critical endpoints including URL analysis, report sharing, and analytics
- **Storage**: In-memory rate limiting with automatic window reset
- **Protection**: Prevents brute-force attacks, DoS attempts, and API abuse

```typescript
// Rate limiting configuration
const WINDOW_SIZE_MS = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute
const MAX_REQUESTS = 10; // Max 10 requests per minute per IP

export async function rateLimitMiddleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // IP-based rate limiting with automatic cleanup
}
```

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Schema Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for comprehensive input validation across all API endpoints
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the application
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) with parameterized queries provides robust protection
- **XSS Prevention**: React's automatic JSX escaping prevents script injection
- **Content Security**: Careful handling of user-generated content with validation and sanitization

### API Endpoint Security
- **Authentication Required**: All user-specific endpoints require valid session authentication
- **Authorization Checks**: Role-based access control for admin endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that don't leak sensitive information
- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive input validation on all endpoints

## Payment Security

### PCI Compliance
- **Payment Processors**: All payment processing handled by PCI-compliant providers:
  - **Stripe**: PCI Service Provider Level 1 certified
  - **PayPal**: Industry-standard payment security
- **Data Isolation**: No sensitive payment data stored on LinkShield servers
- **Metadata Only**: Only non-sensitive identifiers (`stripe_customer_id`, `paypal_order_id`) stored locally

### Webhook Security
- **Stripe Webhooks**: Verified using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` signature validation
- **PayPal Webhooks**: Authenticated using PayPal's verification system with `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`
- **Signature Verification**: All webhook payloads verified before processing
- **Replay Protection**: Webhook signatures prevent replay attacks

```typescript
// Webhook security implementation
const signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  body, signature, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
)
```

## Data Security

### Database Security
- **ORM Protection**: Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
- **Connection Security**: Encrypted database connections
- **Access Control**: Database access restricted to application layer only
- **Data Validation**: Schema-level validation ensures data integrity

### Encryption and Storage
- **Data at Rest**: Database encryption for sensitive data
- **Data in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing for user passwords
- **Session Security**: Encrypted JWT tokens with secure cookie attributes

### Content Security
- **URL Analysis**: Secure analysis of external URLs without exposing internal systems
- **AI Integration**: Secure API communication with AI services
- **Report Storage**: Encrypted storage of analysis results
- **File Handling**: Secure processing of user uploads and exports

## Network Security

### HTTPS and TLS
- **Forced HTTPS**: All communications encrypted with TLS
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security headers:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `Content-Security-Policy`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
