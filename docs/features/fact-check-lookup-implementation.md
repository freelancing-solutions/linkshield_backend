# Fact-Check Lookup Implementation

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive fact-check lookup functionality for the CommunityNotesAnalyzer as part of task 8.3 in the social-protection-production-readiness spec.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality

The `lookup_fact_checks()` method provides:

1. **Keyword-Based Matching**: Matches claims against a database of known fact-checked claims using keyword overlap
2. **AI Semantic Matching**: Optional AI-powered semantic matching for more nuanced claim detection
3. **Multiple Fact-Check Databases**: References to Snopes, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, Reuters, and AP fact-checkers
4. **Comprehensive Verdict System**: Supports verdicts: false, misleading, true, unproven

### Known False Claims Database

Built-in database includes commonly debunked claims:
- 5G/COVID conspiracy theories
- Vaccine misinformation
- Election fraud claims
- Climate change denial
- Health misinformation (bleach cures, etc.)
- Flat earth and moon landing conspiracies

### Key Features

1. **Keyword Match Scoring**: Calculates match ratio based on keyword overlap (60% threshold)
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for each match
3. **Match Type Tracking**: Distinguishes between keyword_match and ai_semantic_match
4. **Misinformation Risk Calculation**: Aggregates verdicts into overall risk score
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Generates specific recommendations based on findings

### API Methods

#### `lookup_fact_checks(claims, use_ai=True)`
Main method for fact-checking extracted claims.

**Returns:**
- total_claims_analyzed
- fact_checks_found
- fact_check_coverage
- verdicts breakdown
- misinformation_risk_score
- detailed fact_check_results
- recommendations

#### `analyze_with_fact_checks(content, platform, metadata)`
Comprehensive analysis combining:
- Community Notes risk analysis
- Claim extraction
- Fact-check lookup
- Source credibility assessment
- Combined risk scoring



## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_community_notes_fact_check.py`:

- ✅ 13 tests covering all functionality
- ✅ Tests for known false claims detection
- ✅ Tests for multiple claims processing
- ✅ Tests for AI semantic matching
- ✅ Tests for misleading claims
- ✅ Tests for recommendation generation
- ✅ Tests for comprehensive analysis
- ✅ Tests for error handling
- ✅ Tests for edge cases (empty claims, no matches)

All tests pass successfully.

## Usage Example

```python
from src.social_protection.content_analyzer.community_notes_analyzer import CommunityNotesAnalyzer
from src.services.ai_service import AIService

# Initialize analyzer
ai_service = AIService()
analyzer = CommunityNotesAnalyzer(ai_service)

# Extract and fact-check claims
claims = await analyzer.extract_claims(content)
fact_check_results = await analyzer.lookup_fact_checks(claims, use_ai=True)

# Or use comprehensive analysis
results = await analyzer.analyze_with_fact_checks(
    content="Your content here",
    platform="twitter"
)

print(f"Risk Score: {results['combined_risk_score']}")
print(f"Verdict: {results['overall_verdict']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {results['recommendations']}")
```

## Integration Points

- Integrates with existing `extract_claims()` method
- Integrates with existing `assess_source_credibility()` method
- Works with AI service for semantic matching
- Compatible with all platform types

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production:
1. Connect to real-time fact-check APIs (Google Fact Check API, ClaimReview)
2. Expand known claims database with regular updates
3. Add machine learning model for claim similarity
4. Implement caching for frequently checked claims
5. Add support for multilingual fact-checking

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ Requirement 3.4: Implement fact-check lookup with database integration
✅ Provides comprehensive fact-checking capabilities
✅ Includes multiple fact-check database references
✅ Supports both keyword and AI-based matching
✅ Generates actionable recommendations
✅ Fully tested with 100% test pass rate
