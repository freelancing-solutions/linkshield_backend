# Dashboard Models Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive dashboard functionality by creating new database models and enhancing existing ones to support project management, team collaboration, monitoring configuration, and alert systems.

## Models Created

### 1. Project Models (`src/models/project.py`)

#### Project
- **Purpose**: Core project management for dashboard functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Project ownership and management
  - Website URL and domain tracking
  - Monitoring enable/disable functionality
  - Project settings storage (JSON)
  - Scan tracking with timestamps
  - Team member management
  - Access control methods

#### ProjectMember
- **Purpose**: Team collaboration and project membership
- **Key Features**:
  - Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer)
  - Invitation system with tokens
  - Join tracking and status management
  - Permission checking methods
  - One-to-many relationship with projects and users

#### MonitoringConfig
- **Purpose**: Project-specific scan configuration
- **Key Features**:
  - Configurable scan frequency (default: 24 hours)
  - Scan depth and link limits
  - Toggle for different scan types (broken links, harmful content, security threats, performance, SEO)
  - Advanced settings (exclude patterns, subdomains, redirects, timeouts)
  - Scan scheduling with next scan calculation
  - Scan count tracking

#### ProjectAlert
- **Purpose**: Alert preferences and notification system
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple alert types (broken links, harmful content, scan failed, security threats)
  - Multiple channels (email, dashboard, webhook)
  - Threshold-based alerting
  - Rate limiting (1 hour minimum between alerts)
  - Delivery configuration (JSON)
  - Alert count tracking

### 2. Enhanced Subscription Plan (`src/models/subscription.py`)

Added monitoring-specific limits to existing SubscriptionPlan model:
- `max_projects`: Maximum projects per user (default: 1)
- `max_team_members_per_project`: Maximum team members per project (default: 1)
- `max_alerts_per_project`: Maximum alerts per project (default: 5)
- `monitoring_frequency_minutes`: Minimum scan frequency in minutes (default: 1440 = 24 hours)

## Database Migration (`alembic/versions/004_add_dashboard_project_models.py`)

### Tables Created
1. **projects**: Core project management table
2. **project_members**: Team membership and roles
3. **monitoring_configs**: Project-specific scan settings
4. **project_alerts**: Alert preferences and tracking

### Enums Created
1. **project_role**: OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER
2. **alert_type**: BROKEN_LINKS, HARMFUL_CONTENT, SCAN_FAILED, SECURITY_THREAT
3. **alert_channel**: EMAIL, DASHBOARD, WEBHOOK

### Indexes Created
- Performance-optimized indexes on all foreign keys
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Unique constraints for project-member and project-alert combinations
- Status and timestamp indexes for filtering

### Backward Compatibility
- All new columns have default values
- Existing data remains unaffected
- Migration includes proper downgrade functionality

## Integration Updates

### Models Import (`src/models/__init__.py`)
- Added all new project models to central import
- Included enums for external use
- Maintained alphabetical organization

### Database Configuration (`src/config/database.py`)
- Updated model imports in `init_db()` function
- Added project models to ensure table creation
- Maintained existing import patterns

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Project Management
- Create and manage multiple projects per user
- Project ownership and access control
- Website monitoring enable/disable
- Project settings customization

### 2. Team Collaboration
- Invite team members with role-based permissions
- Invitation system with tokens and expiration
- Permission checking for different operations
- Member status tracking

### 3. Monitoring Configuration
- Per-project scan settings
- Configurable scan frequency and depth
- Toggle different scan types
- Advanced filtering options

### 4. Alert System
- Multiple alert types for different issues
- Flexible delivery channels
- Threshold-based triggering
- Rate limiting to prevent spam

### 5. Subscription Integration
- Plan-based limits for projects, team members, and alerts
- Monitoring frequency restrictions by plan
- Scalable limits for different subscription tiers

## Validation Results

✅ **Syntax Validation**: All Python files compile successfully
✅ **Model Structure**: Follows existing codebase patterns and conventions
✅ **Migration Logic**: Proper upgrade/downgrade functions with error handling
✅ **Database Integration**: Models properly imported and registered
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Project
```python
project = Project(
    user_id=user_id,
    name="My Website",
    description="Main company website",
    website_url="https://example.com",
    domain="example.com"
)
```

### Adding Team Members
```python
member = ProjectMember(
    project_id=project_id,
    user_id=member_user_id,
    role=ProjectRole.EDITOR,
    invitation_token=generate_token()
)
```

### Configuring Monitoring
```python
config = MonitoringConfig(
    project_id=project_id,
    scan_frequency_minutes=720,  # 12 hours
    check_broken_links=True,
    check_security_threats=True,
    max_links_per_scan=200
)
```

### Setting Up Alerts
```python
alert = ProjectAlert(
    project_id=project_id,
    user_id=user_id,
    alert_type=AlertType.BROKEN_LINKS,
    channel=AlertChannel.EMAIL,
    is_enabled=True
)
```

## Next Steps

1. **API Controllers**: Create REST API endpoints for project management
2. **Frontend Integration**: Build dashboard UI components
3. **Background Jobs**: Implement scan scheduling and alert delivery
4. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all new models
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new endpoints

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Supports multiple projects per user with plan-based limits
- **Collaboration**: Team-based project management with role-based access
- **Flexibility**: Configurable monitoring settings per project
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive alert system with rate limiting
- **Maintainability**: Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- **Performance**: Optimized database structure with proper indexing

This implementation provides a solid foundation for dashboard functionality while maintaining the existing codebase's quality and consistency standards.
