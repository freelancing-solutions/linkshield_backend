# Discord Webhook Authentication Security Fix

## Overview

This document details the security improvements made to Discord webhook authentication, replacing the insecure HMAC fallback with proper Ed25519 cryptographic verification.

## Security Vulnerability Fixed

### Previous Implementation
- Used HMAC-SHA256 as a fallback mechanism for Discord webhook signature verification
- This was cryptographically weaker and not aligned with Discord's security standards
- Created potential security vulnerabilities in webhook authentication

### Current Implementation
- Implements proper Ed25519 signature verification as required by Discord
- Removes all insecure HMAC fallback mechanisms
- Uses Discord's official public key for verification

## Implementation Details

### Configuration
```bash
# Required environment variable
LINKSHIELD_DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_application_public_key_hex
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Settings Configuration (`src/config/settings.py`)
```python
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, env="LINKSHIELD_DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY")
```

#### 2. Ed25519 Verification (`src/auth/bot_auth.py`)
- Uses `cryptography` library's `Ed25519PublicKey` for verification
- Validates signature format (128 hex characters)
- Validates timestamp format (numeric string)
- Performs proper Ed25519 signature verification on `timestamp + payload`

#### 3. Centralized Verification (`src/bots/registration.py`)
- Removed local HMAC implementation
- Now uses centralized `WebhookSignatureVerifier` for consistency
- Maintains proper error handling and logging

### Security Benefits

1. **Cryptographic Strength**: Ed25519 provides stronger cryptographic guarantees than HMAC-SHA256
2. **Discord Compliance**: Aligns with Discord's official security requirements
3. **No Fallback Vulnerabilities**: Eliminates insecure fallback mechanisms
4. **Proper Key Management**: Uses dedicated Discord public key configuration

### Verification Process

1. **Header Validation**: Validates presence of `X-Signature-Ed25519` and `X-Signature-Timestamp`
2. **Format Validation**: Ensures signature is 128 hex characters and timestamp is numeric
3. **Key Parsing**: Converts hex-encoded public key to `Ed25519PublicKey` object
4. **Message Construction**: Creates verification message as `timestamp + payload`
5. **Signature Verification**: Uses Ed25519 algorithm to verify signature authenticity

### Error Handling

- **Missing Configuration**: Logs error if Discord public key is not configured
- **Invalid Format**: Warns about malformed signatures or timestamps
- **Verification Failure**: Logs warning for failed signature verification
- **Exception Handling**: Catches and logs unexpected errors during verification

### Testing Considerations

When testing Discord webhook authentication:

1. **Valid Signatures**: Use Discord's official signature generation for testing
2. **Invalid Signatures**: Test with malformed or incorrect signatures
3. **Missing Headers**: Verify proper handling of missing signature headers
4. **Configuration**: Test behavior with missing or invalid public key configuration

### Migration Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Add `LINKSHIELD_DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` to your environment
- **Public Key Format**: Ensure the public key is in hex format (64 characters)
- **Backward Compatibility**: No backward compatibility with HMAC fallback (security improvement)

### Security Considerations

1. **Key Security**: Protect the Discord public key configuration
2. **Timestamp Validation**: Consider implementing timestamp freshness checks
3. **Rate Limiting**: Ensure webhook endpoints have appropriate rate limiting
4. **Logging**: Monitor for signature verification failures as potential security events
