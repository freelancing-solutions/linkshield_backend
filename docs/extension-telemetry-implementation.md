# Extension Data Processor Telemetry Implementation

## Overview

Comprehensive telemetry and metrics collection has been implemented for the ExtensionDataProcessor service to enable monitoring, performance tracking, and operational insights.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Metrics Module (`src/social_protection/metrics.py`)

Created a centralized metrics module with Prometheus-compatible metrics for tracking:

#### Request Metrics
- `extension_requests_total` - Total extension requests processed (by platform, content_type, status)
- `extension_batch_requests_total` - Total batch requests processed (by status)
- `extension_processing_duration_seconds` - Request processing duration histogram
- `extension_batch_processing_duration_seconds` - Batch processing duration histogram

#### Risk Assessment Metrics
- `extension_risk_assessments_total` - Total risk assessments performed (by platform, risk_level)
- `extension_risk_factors_detected_total` - Total risk factors detected (by platform, risk_type)
- `extension_confidence_score` - Distribution of confidence scores

#### AI Analysis Metrics
- `extension_ai_analysis_total` - Total AI analyses performed (by platform, status)
- `extension_ai_analysis_duration_seconds` - AI analysis duration histogram
- `extension_ai_threats_detected_total` - Total threats detected by AI (by platform, threat_type)

#### Cache Metrics
- `extension_cache_operations_total` - Total cache operations (by operation, result)
- `extension_cache_size` - Current number of entries in cache
- `extension_cache_hit_rate` - Cache hit rate (0-1)

#### Link Safety Metrics
- `extension_link_checks_total` - Total link safety checks (by platform, is_safe)
- `extension_link_check_duration_seconds` - Link check duration histogram

#### Error Metrics
- `extension_errors_total` - Total errors encountered (by error_type, operation)
- `extension_timeouts_total` - Total timeout errors (by operation)

#### Batch Processing Metrics
- `extension_batch_items_processed_total` - Total items processed in batches (by status)
- `extension_batch_size` - Batch request sizes histogram

#### Concurrency Metrics
- `extension_concurrent_requests` - Current number of concurrent requests being processed

#### Content Analysis Metrics
- `extension_content_patterns_matched_total` - Total content patterns matched (by platform, pattern_type)
- `extension_platform_indicators_matched_total` - Total platform-specific indicators matched (by platform, indicator_type)

### 2. Integration Points

Metrics are recorded at key points throughout the ExtensionDataProcessor:

#### Request Processing
- Start/end of request processing
- Success/failure status
- Processing duration
- Concurrent request tracking

#### Cache Operations
- Cache hits/misses
- Cache size updates
- Hit rate calculation
- Cache evictions

#### Risk Assessment
- Risk level determination
- Confidence score tracking
- Individual risk factor detection

#### AI Analysis
- AI service invocation
- Analysis duration
- Threat detection
- Error handling

#### Link Safety Checks
- URL validation
- Safety determination
- Processing time

#### Batch Processing
- Batch size tracking
- Item-level success/failure
- Overall batch duration

### 3. Helper Functions

The metrics module provides convenient helper functions:

- `record_request_processed()` - Record a processed extension request
- `record_batch_processed()` - Record a processed batch request
- `record_risk_assessment()` - Record a risk assessment
- `record_risk_factor()` - Record a detected risk factor
- `record_ai_analysis()` - Record an AI analysis
- `record_cache_operation()` - Record a cache operation
- `update_cache_metrics()` - Update cache metrics
- `record_link_check()` - Record a link safety check
- `record_error()` - Record an error
- `record_timeout()` - Record a timeout
- `record_batch_item()` - Record a batch item processed
- `record_content_pattern_match()` - Record a content pattern match
- `record_platform_indicator_match()` - Record a platform indicator match
- `increment_concurrent_requests()` - Increment concurrent request counter
- `decrement_concurrent_requests()` - Decrement concurrent request counter

### 4. Cache Metrics Tracking

Added internal tracking for cache statistics:

- `_cache_hits` - Total cache hits
- `_cache_misses` - Total cache misses
- `_total_cache_operations` - Total cache operations
- `_update_cache_metrics()` - Method to update Prometheus metrics

### 5. Dependencies

Added `prometheus-client` to `requirements.txt` for Prometheus metrics support.

## Usage

### Accessing Metrics

Metrics are automatically collected during normal operation. To expose them for Prometheus scraping, add a metrics endpoint to your FastAPI application:

```python
from prometheus_client import generate_latest, CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST
from fastapi import Response

@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics():
    return Response(
        content=generate_latest(),
        media_type=CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST
    )
```

### Monitoring Dashboards

The metrics can be visualized using Grafana or similar tools. Recommended dashboards:

1. **Request Performance**
   - Request rate by platform
   - Processing duration percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Error rate
   - Timeout rate

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Risk level distribution
   - Confidence score distribution
   - Risk factors detected over time

3. **Cache Performance**
   - Cache hit rate
   - Cache size
   - Cache operations rate

4. **AI Analysis**
   - AI analysis rate
   - AI processing duration
   - Threat detection rate

5. **Batch Processing**
   - Batch size distribution
   - Batch processing duration
   - Item success/failure rates

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been added in `tests/test_extension_telemetry.py` to verify:

- Metrics are recorded on successful requests
- Cache metrics are tracked correctly
- Risk assessment metrics are captured
- Pattern matching metrics are recorded
- Link check metrics are collected
- Batch processing metrics are tracked
- Error metrics are recorded
- Concurrent request tracking works
- Cache statistics are available

## Performance Impact

The telemetry implementation has minimal performance impact:

- Metrics recording is synchronous but extremely fast (microseconds)
- No external network calls for metrics collection
- Metrics are stored in-memory and exposed via HTTP endpoint
- Cache tracking adds negligible overhead

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Add metrics for specific threat types detected
2. Track user-specific metrics (with privacy considerations)
3. Add metrics for platform-specific analysis
4. Implement custom alerting rules
5. Add metrics for content type distribution
6. Track geographic distribution of requests (if available)

## Compliance

The telemetry implementation:

- Does not collect PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Aggregates data at platform/type level
- Follows Prometheus best practices
- Supports GDPR compliance through data aggregation

## Requirement Satisfaction

This implementation satisfies **Requirement 11.2** from the specification:

> WHEN API endpoints are called THEN request counts, latencies, and error rates SHALL be tracked

The implementation provides comprehensive tracking of:
- ✅ Request counts (by platform, content type, status)
- ✅ Latencies (processing duration histograms)
- ✅ Error rates (error counters by type and operation)
- ✅ Additional metrics for risk assessment, caching, AI analysis, and more

## Conclusion

The telemetry implementation provides comprehensive observability into the ExtensionDataProcessor service, enabling:

- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Error detection and debugging
- Capacity planning
- SLA compliance verification
- Operational insights
