**Risk Level:** Critical  
**Impact:** Potential code injection vulnerabilities  

**Affected Areas:**
- Third-party dependencies
- Development tools and scripts
- Test utilities

**Recommendations:**
1. Audit all `eval()` and `exec()` usage
2. Replace `subprocess.call(..., shell=True)` with safer alternatives
3. Implement input sanitization for dynamic code execution
4. Use parameterized queries for database operations

### 2. Weak Cryptographic Algorithms (HIGH)
**Issue:** Weak cryptographic algorithms found in 5,841 files  
**Risk Level:** High  
**Impact:** Potential cryptographic vulnerabilities  

**Affected Areas:**

**Recommendations:**
1. Update all dependencies to latest versions
2. Replace MD5/SHA1 with SHA-256 or stronger
3. Replace DES/RC4 with AES encryption
4. Implement cryptographic library audit process
